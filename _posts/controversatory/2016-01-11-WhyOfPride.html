<p>We were all walking with each other after the drag show. A college age group; getting that taste of freedom on a rural Wisconsin campus.</p>
<p>His phone rang.</p>
<p class="italic center">"Hi, mom."<br/>"Nah, I'm just hanging out with some people."<br/>"We we're watching a movie."</p>
<p class="center">A bit of silence.</p>
<p class="italic center">"I'll call you back"</p>
<p class="center">More silence.</p>
<p class="italic center">"Sorry about that..."</p>
<p class="center">Another girl spoke up.</p>
<p class="italic center">"That's OK. I lie too."<br/></p>
<hr/>
<p>We all lie.</p>
<p>We all have lists running through our head of who's safe.
<p>Who knows.</p>
<p>Who can't.</p>
<p>Who might be OK.<br/>
&emsp;Until you find out otherwise.<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;That always stings.</p>
<p>It's not necessarily a closet so much as it is a safety measure.</p>
<p>And even the ones who are totally out get exhausted from explaining.</p>
<p>Coming out over and over again to everyone they meet.<br/>
&emsp;Watching faces to gauge reactions.<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;Answering the same questions time and time again.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Pride isn't about being flamboyant.<br/>
Pride isn't rainbows, glitter, leather and dildos.<br/>
Pride is the opposite of shame.</p>

<p>Pride is accepting that there isn't anything to be personally ashamed of.<br/>
Pride is a statement for the people who think that there is.</p>

<p>It doesn't matter if you're taking pride in your sexuality, or your gender identity, or how you like to dress, or what your friends go through: pride is a place to find people like you.</p>
<p>People who are sick of the shame.</p>
<p>People who are exhausted from explaining.</p>
<p>People who are tired of their lists.</p>
<p>People who've lied too.</p>
