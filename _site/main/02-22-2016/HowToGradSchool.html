<hr/>
<p><span class="TheFlirtyBolding">"TAKE THIS CAREER AND SHOVE IT!"</span> you scream from your rooftop. Lightning cackles in the background. Birds fly away in fear for their lives. It's time, you've decided: you're going back to school.</p>

<p>My first advice is to stop.</p>

<p>Breathe.</p>

<p>Don't make a 30,000 dollar impulse buy. Debt is bad.</p>

<p>Let's think things through.</p>

<p class="mmmColor"><b>Why are you going back to grad school?</b></p>

<p><span class="TheFlirtyBolding">More money!</span> If you're taking out student loans to go to grad school, you aren't going to be making more money -- you're going to be paying more bills.</p>

<p><span class="TheFlirtyBolding">It's free!</span> If you have the time and energy for school, then by all means go for it. But just because it's free doesn't mean it's worth the effort.</p>

<p><span class="TheFlirtyBolding">A Master's degree will advance my current career.</span> Are you sure? There are a couple of fields where that is definitely true:  social work, psychiatry, some teaching. Other times, you're better off trying to get real work experience.</p>

<p><span class="TheFlirtyBolding">A Master's degree will let me change my career.</span> OK, if you think that it's necessary. I mean, this was me: I sought my Master's degree after working for almost 5 years.  I have an undergraduate degree in Computer Science, and am studying something only tangentially related. This is also the path of most of my classmates. But, just because this is how I handled my situation doesn't mean it's the best way for you.</p>

<p><span class="TheFlirtyBolding">I just finished my Bachelor's degree...</span> <span style="font-size: .3em;">...Oh, God.</span></p>

<p><span class="TheFlirtyBolding">&emsp;...and don't know what else to do.</span> No. No, no, nope, no. Go do something else.</p>

<p><span class="TheFlirtyBolding">&emsp;...and I just want to school to be over.</span> I'm glad you can recognize that. You need to stop; you're burning or burnt out. Go work. Go rest. Come back when you're ready. Grad school will still be there later.</p>

<p><span class="TheFlirtyBolding">&emsp;...and need a Master's degree for my field.</span>  I switched careers after less than 5 years. You might wanna make sure you made the right choice by working in the real world before you continue school.</p>

<p><span class="TheFlirtyBolding">&emsp;...and I love school!</span> How fabulous! That doesn't mean you should keep going.</p>

<p class="TheAudience">Then when should I go to grad school?</p>

<p>You should only go to grad school if you can answer, with passion, the following question:</p>

<p class="mmmColor"><b>Why are you studying what you are studying?</b></p>

<p>If you are not going to grad school with a clear sense of purpose, you should not be there.</p>

<p>You do not go to grad school to get a degree. You go to grad school with a clear, precise goal.</p>

<p>You don't need a Master's in Psychiatry. You need the skills to open your own practice in couple's counseling.</p>

<p>You don't need a Master's in Computer Science. You needed more experience with programming robotics so you can help invent more in the future.</p>

<p>What is your goal after your degree? What interests you about your selected program?</p>

<p>That's not just an admissions question; it's something you need to actually care about.</p>

<p>You absolutely need to know this before you even apply to graduate school.</p>

<p class="TheAudience">So...what's so different about grad school?</p>

<p>The key difference between graduate school and undergraduate school is how much every decision you make towards your degree matters.</p>

<p>On the first day of class, the professor will ask you why you took the class. And he means it.</p>

<p>When you talk with your advisor, she will ask you why you're interested in a class. And she means it.</p>

<p>Because they want to know what your bigger goal is.</p>

<p>You don't get to answer that question with 'because it met a requirement.'</p>

<p>Nothing in graduate school is a throw away course you take to get an easy A. Everything matters.</p>

<p class="TheAudience">Should I work before graduate school?</p>

<p>I do not recommended going to graduate school without at least a few years of real work experience.</p>

<p>Real work experience lets you develop connections with your co-workers and bosses. It doesn't matter if you hate or love your co-workers: people are wiggly, living resources that can be helpful regardless of your opinions of them. Even if the way <span class="DammitJannet">Jannet From Accounting&copy;</span> sniffs her nose every five minutes drives you up the wall and back, you'll also be forever grateful to her for teaching you your mad Excel skills.</p>

<p>It also gives you real reflection into the needs of <span class="ZaWF">The Workforce</span>. <i>*dramatic music*</i> </p>

<p><span class="ZaWF">The Workforce</span> is not the big scary thing you may think it is. You will use your experience in <span class="ZaWF">The Workforce</span> to come up with your thesis, have discussions with your classmates, and work on assignments. This is true even if your time in <span class="ZaWF">The Workforce</span> isn't in the field you're studying. Any experience is valuable, even if that experience is having to deal with <span class="DammitJannet">Jannet From Accounting&copy;</span>.</p>
