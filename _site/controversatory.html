    <p><a href="/controversatory/02-08-2017/BurningStrawMen">Burning Straw Men</a> - February 08, 2017<br/> Political issues are very nuanced to be simplified. But, simplifications are all we seem to see. Never forget the real depth that exists with any issue. Never forget that people are people

    <p><a href="/controversatory/02-03-2017/Failure">Failure</a> - February 03, 2017<br/> Failure is what scares me the most. Everyone around me is going to know. Everyone's going to ask me what happened.

    <p><a href="/controversatory/01-11-2016/WhyOfPride">The Why of Pride</a> - January 11, 2016<br/> Pride is a place to find people like you. People who are exhausted from explaining. People who lie too.

    <p><a href="/controversatory/12-18-2015/UremarkableExpectations">Break Expectations and Be Unremarkable</a> - December 18, 2015<br/> We all have silent expectations about the way things are. It doesn't mean it's bad when those expectations are violated; heck, we may want them broken. But it does mean they're there, lingering in the backs of our minds. Things don't jump out when they're unremarkable.
